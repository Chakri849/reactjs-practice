            <P>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a
                paragraph is
                a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity
                and
                coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</P>
